## Local development

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as package manager. To start a local development server, run:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

## Contribution (just in case lol)

- Every commit must have a meaningful commit message with a Signed-off-by, and signed with trusted GPG key.
- Make sure `pnpm lint` is passed and `pnpm build` is successful.
- Create pull requests against the `main` branch.
- CodeQL scans will be run on every pull request to ensure code security. All checks must pass before merging.
- GitHub Copilot will be used to assist PR reviews.
